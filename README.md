# hello-world
My first repository

On January 27th 2022, I went over the tutorial on how to use githubs. I learned what branches, commits, and pull requests, and merge are. 

## commit 

Each commit is associated with a commit message. Commit messages explain why a particular change is made to the respository. Commit messages capture the history of my changes so that other contributors can understand what I did and why

## pull request

When I open a pull request, I am proposing to other contributors my changes and requesting them to review and pull in my contribution to merge it into the branch.

I can open a pull request for people to discuss as long as I make a commit, even before the code is finished

## merge

After you make your pull request, someone in the organization will check your pull request to decide on whether they want to merge the request to their branch or not. Only after a merge will mean that the work you did is received by the team.

## Key steps of contributing in github:
1. create a repository (project folder)
2. start a new branch
3. commit changes to new branch
4. submit a pull request
5. review and merge a pull request
