# hello-world
My first repository

On January 27th 2022, I went over the tutorial on how to use githubs. I learned what branches, commits, and pull requests are. 

## commit 

Each commit is associated with a commit message. Commit messages explain why a particular change is made to the respository. Commit messages capture the history of my changes so that other contributors can understand what I did and why

## pull request

When I open a pull request, I am proposing to other contributors my changes and requesting them to review and pull in my contribution to merge it into the branch.

I can open a pull request for people to discuss as long as I make a commit, even before the code is finished
